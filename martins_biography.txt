Hello, My name is Martin Freiwald. I am student at Seattle Central College. My major of study is Network Design & Administration.  I have a second major Database Development and Administration certificate. I am an Honor Student since June 2017.  I like on the Kent East hill in King County, WA.    

I know you all love computing and aspects of using a computer in some way. Or you would not be reading this according to the whole section of Almanacs at a library.  That's a joke!  I started reading wikipeadia.org about who a program works the type programming language applications use.    Then I read about what is inside a programming language and how does it flop from one operation to the next.  I kept track of defintions from that reading and when deeper into the detail of it.  

I grew up in the same house I am in today.  I like living on the Kent East hill.  My first computer was an Texas Instruments TI-99.  I like to play video games on it.  I did write some programs from the Sams programming guide for the TI-99.  I was in fourth grade back then.
